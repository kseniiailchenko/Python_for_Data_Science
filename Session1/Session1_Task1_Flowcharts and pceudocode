Task 1
Create a flowchart and pseudocode for these cases:
Define if a given number is prime or not.
A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. 
Or, it is a natural number that can be divided only by 1 and itself.

Task 2
French tax deduction
Rule 1: Income Threshold Based on Tax Reference Income (RFR)
To qualify for certain tax reductions or exemptions, the taxpayer's tax reference income (revenu fiscal de référence) must fall below specific annual limits set by the French government.
Rule 2: Family Quotient Advantage
Taxpayers receive reductions based on their family situation, through the “quotient familial” system.
The more dependents (children, elderly relatives, etc.), the more parts are counted in your household, which reduces taxable income.
There is a limit to the tax reduction per half-share, which was €1,759 in 2024.
Rule 3: Eligibility Through Deductible Expenses and Credits
Certain life expenses can make taxpayers eligible for tax reductions or credits, such as:
Home help services (e.g., cleaners, nannies): 50% credit on eligible costs
Childcare for children under 6: 50% credit on up to €3,500 of expenses
Energy-saving home improvements: Eligible for the “MaPrimeRénov” or other eco-tax benefits
